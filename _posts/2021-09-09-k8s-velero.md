<h2> Introduction </h2>

We have to back up the applications which are deployed on a Kubernetes cluster to protect loss. There are many tools to backup and restore k8s resources like velero and Kasten 10. If you have backups, it is easy to restore if the cluster goes down or an application crashes accidentally. You can also back up k8s resources and persistent volumes on Kubernetes clusters. You can use velero not only to back up and restore but also to migrate clusters. For example, to migrate the PVC used for the database in the on-prem k8s cluster, you have to export database dumps from the old cluster at first then import the dumped databases to the database in the new cluster. Velero can solve these problems. When k8s clusters are migrated, there are limitations to migrating to PVC. The storage class of the PVC which you want to backup must be in the new cluster. You have to use same common bucket if you want to migrate resources among multiple clusters. Velero does not support host path PVC. You can create snapshots on cloud storage volumes such as EBS and azure disks. If you do not want to create snapshots manually, you can also use velero to back up persistent volumes on managed k8s clusters.

<h2> Installation </h2>

Firstly you have to create a kubernetes cluster. I will use azure aks cluster with two worker nodes for this demo. So, let me create an aks cluster.

```bash
thaunghtikeoo@thaunghtikeoo:~$ az group create --name demo --location eastus && az aks create --name demo -g demo --location eastus --node-count 2 
```
My k8s cluster is ready now. Check the status of cluster's nodes.

```bash
thaunghtikeoo@thaunghtikeoo:~$ kubectl get nodes 
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE    VERSION
aks-nodepool1-32685854-vmss000000   Ready    agent   112s   v1.20.9
aks-nodepool1-32685854-vmss000001   Ready    agent   2m1s   v1.20.9
```
Then you have to install velero cli binary on your machine. You can download velero cli [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/tag/v1.6.3). After downloading binary, extract the tarball and move velero to /usr/local/bin.

```bash
thaunghtikeoo@thaunghtikeoo:~$ wget https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/download/v1.6.3/velero-v1.6.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz

thaunghtikeoo@thaunghtikeoo:~$ tar xzvf velero-v1.6.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz && chmod +x velero-v1.6.* && sudo mv velero-v1.6.3-linux-amd64/velero /usr/local/bin/velero
```
<h2> Velero supported providers </h2>

Velero supports a variety of storage providers for different backup and snapshot operations. You can check [here](https://velero.io/docs/v1.6/supported-providers) to see list of supported providers. I will use Amazon S3 bucket today. You can use Azure Blog Storage or Google Cloud Storage as you want. Before installing Velero on kubernetes cluster, create a S3 bucket which will be used to store backup and restore tar files.

```bash
BUCKET=tho-velero-demo
REGION=us-east-1
aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --region $REGION 
```
Now, I'm ready to install VELERO on my aks cluster. 

```bash
thaunghtikeoo@thaunghtikeoo:~$ velero install --provider aws --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.2.1 --bucket $BUCKET --backup-location-config region=$REGION --snapshot-location-config region=$REGION --secret-file ~/.aws/credentials 
```
You will get outputs like this after a couple of miniutes.

```bash
Deployment/velero: attempting to create resource
Deployment/velero: attempting to create resource client
Deployment/velero: created
Velero is installed! â›µ Use 'kubectl logs deployment/velero -n velero' to view the status.
```
