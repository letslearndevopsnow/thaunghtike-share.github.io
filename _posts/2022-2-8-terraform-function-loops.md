<h1> Introduction </h1>

Hi guys, today I will talk about how to setup gitlab runner autoscaling using AwS spot instances. I already made a post for gitlab runner autoscaling using GCP preemptible vms. You can read it [here](https://blog.thaunghtikeoo.info/2021/07/14/gitlab-runner-gcp). There is no differences between preemptible VMs and aws spot instances. They are the same concepts. So I will only write to set up labs.
